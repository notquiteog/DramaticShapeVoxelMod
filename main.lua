-- DRAMATIC SHAPE VOXEL MOD BATTLE ART: a full 3D diorama overworld, shipped as a
-- rendering pipeline mod.
--
-- The engine's render_pipelines registry (src/mods/Schemas.lua) lets a mod
-- own part of the frame.  This mod registers two:
--
--   voxel      a drawWorld pipeline.  Instead of the flat tile blit, the
--              overworld's terrain is extruded into real geometry, walked
--              by a depth-buffered 3D camera, with characters as leaning
--              sprite slabs and a shadow map throwing real cast shadows
--              across whatever they land on.  Occlusion is the depth
--              buffer, not a y-sort: walk behind a building and the
--              building is simply in front.
--
--   tiltshift  a worldPresent pipeline -- the stage that post-processes
--              the finished world BEFORE the UI composites over it.  A
--              tilt-shift blur that sells the miniature-model look, on the
--              diorama only, leaving text boxes and menus crisp.
--
-- Everything a display mode needs beyond the two draw functions -- the
-- OFF/15/35/50 ladder, the options rows, the hotkeys, persistence in
-- save.options.pipelines, the free-roam gate, the mutual exclusion with
-- the engine's TILT mode -- is engine plumbing driven by the records
-- below.  This file declares; lib/ draws.
--
-- Voxel mode is presentational: it changes what the world LOOKS like and
-- nothing about what it IS.  ONE rung is the deliberate exception. 1ST --
-- the first-person camera -- replaces the grid WALK with a free,
-- camera-relative one while it is selected (lib/FreeMove.lua), because a
-- head you can steer with a mouse demands feet that go where it looks.
-- Even there the game is untouched: the walk asks the engine's own
-- collision the same questions a grid step asks, keeps the player's
-- logical cell synced, and fires the engine's own landing pipeline per
-- cell crossed -- warps, encounters, ledges, gates and scripts all run
-- exactly as themselves. Step off the rung and the grid walk is back.

-- behind the battle under WORLD, and that call routes through
-- Pipelines.worldPipeline -- so the thing behind a Gen 2 battle IS the
-- diorama. WORLD is the mode 3D-BTL needs there, and lib/Gen2Battle.lua holds

-- returned canvas with `draw(canvas, 0, 0, 0, 1/dpiX, 1/dpiY)` -- a scale
-- that only covers the window when the canvas is at PIXEL resolution.
-- Sizing it in units costs the DPI scale TWICE: the canvas is that much
-- smaller, then it is drawn that much smaller again, so the diorama lands
-- in the top-left corner at 1/dpi of the screen.  Desktop never sees it --
-- units and pixels are the same thing there -- but on Android the DPI scale
-- is the display density (2.625 on a 420dpi panel), and the world came out
-- a third of the size in each direction.
--
-- So ask for the pixel dimensions rather than trusting the ctx.  That is
-- the number a fixed engine would hand over, so this keeps working either
-- way instead of double-correcting.  It also squares the FX pass: ctx.scale
-- is ALREADY in pixels per world pixel (Zoom.scale over Renderer:fitScale,
-- which measures the drawable), so the closures ctx.drawFx runs were being

-- each ends up on stay in step.

-- ARRIVES at FULL and not again, so the player can still move the camera or
-- the zoom afterwards -- it is a starting point, not a lock.
--

-- would throw away whatever the player had changed since, and "put it back
-- how it was" is not a thing this can know.

--
--   3  VOXEL    cycle the camera ladder      (was 6; skips FULL)
--   5  V-GRID   toggle the wireframe         (new)
--   6  T-SHIFT  cycle the blur ladder        (was 9)
--   7  V-CURVE  cycle the horizon bend       (new)
--   8  3D-BTL   toggle overworld battles     (new)
--   9  WATER    cycle the water reflections  (new; 9 was T-SHIFT's old key)
--
-- Only 6 arrives by the documented route. Game:keypressed answers the
-- engine's own display keys FIRST and returns -- 2 COLORS, 3 TILT, 4 ZOOM,
-- 5 GBC FX -- and only then offers the key to Pipelines.hotkey, expressly
-- so "a pipeline can never shadow one" (Schemas, render_pipelines.hotkey).
-- 3 and 5 are two of those, and 7 and 8 belong to plain mod settings that
-- own no pass and so have no registry to claim a key from at all.
--
-- So this wraps Game:keypressed. It is the invasive option and it is the
-- only one: polling the keyboard in update() would fire alongside the
-- engine's handler rather than instead of it, so 3 would cycle this mode
-- AND the engine's TILT on the same press.
--
-- Consequences worth being explicit about: while this mod is enabled, TILT
-- (3) and GBC FX (5) are unreachable by key -- and unreachable on the OPTIONS
-- menu too, where both rows are taken away and both values held at zero (see
-- pinEngineFx). Nothing is being hidden that still does something: TILT is the
-- flat fake of what this mode does for real, the registry already forces it
-- off whenever a world pipeline takes the pass, and GBC FX is a full-screen
-- present pass over the top of the diorama. Uninstalling puts both back.
--
-- Everything the engine does around a pipeline hotkey has to happen here
-- too, so the work is DELEGATED rather than reimplemented: Pipelines.hotkey
-- applies its own gate and ladder, and the three lines after it are the
-- engine's own (syncOptions, the tilt exclusion, writeOptions).

-- has to drop that map's cached mesh or the 3D world keeps showing the
-- tree that is no longer there.  The 2D tile renderer invalidates its own
-- caches off the same edit.

-- refresh, not invalidate: the stale mesh keeps drawing while the
-- replacement builds in the background, so a one-block edit (Cut, a
-- door stamp, the tree regrowing on re-entry) repopulates in place
-- instead of blinking the whole scene down to the flat 2D path

-- The event above is the ANNOUNCED edit -- OverworldState:replaceBlock
-- emits it, which is the path Victory Road's barriers and a script's
-- replaceBlock take. Several edits do not go through it:
--
--   Cut          swaps the tree block and rebuilds the 2D renderer
--   the regrowth restores those blocks when the map is re-entered
--   card-key doors are stamped closed on floor load
--
-- all of them writing the block layer directly. Meshes derived from that
-- layer went stale with no announcement -- the cut tree stayed standing,
-- and after a round trip through a door the stump stayed cut because this
-- map's mesh survives in the cache (that is what prevLive is for).
--
-- The engine could announce each of those, and an earlier cut of this
-- work changed it to. That is the wrong place: it edits the game for one
-- mod's benefit, and every future path that writes a block has to
-- remember to do the same. They all funnel through ONE choke point --
-- Map:setBlock -- so wrap that from here instead. Map is a plain
-- metatable shared by every map instance, so this covers all of them,
-- including paths written after this mod.
--
-- Read back rather than trust the argument: setBlock silently ignores an
-- out-of-bounds write, and a stamp that rewrites a block with the value
-- it already held (the door code guards for this, the regrowth does not)
-- is not a change and must not throw the mesh away.
--
-- TEST97: Legendary Cut saplings are a special safe exception. Their source
-- crown is already absent from the terrain mesh and the exposed ground is
-- already baked beneath it; only CommunityFlora's tiny replacement mesh must
-- disappear. Remove that one registry owner directly for a confirmed forward
-- cut-tree swap. TEST105 also restores the saved owner on regrowth while the
-- same map, registries and completed meshes remain valid. Doors, rocks, tall
-- grass, and any regrowth without that proof retain the full refresh path.

-- stick's axes (Game:gamepadaxis passes them to Input, which returns early
-- on anything but the left pair), relative mouse motion (love.mousemoved --
-- there is no Game handler to wrap; the engine's own callback only feeds
-- the mouse-as-touch debug path, which stays untouched), the mouse buttons
-- while the cursor is captured (A and B -- there is no cursor to click UI
-- with), and any touch that lands off the overlay's controls (a drag on
-- open screen is the look; the d-pad and buttons still go to
-- TouchControls, whose own d-pad finger is also read back analog as the
-- move vector). Every wrap forwards whatever it does not claim, and claims
-- only while 1ST is actually driving.
--
-- FreeMove.install wraps OverworldState:handleInput -- the one choke point
-- where the grid walk reads the pad, and the same seam the engine's own
-- Cycling Road pull lives behind. While 1ST drives, the walk is continuous
-- and camera-relative; the player's logical cell stays synced and every
-- per-cell consequence still runs through the engine's own machinery
-- (onStepComplete, checkEdgeExit, checkLedgeHop, checkBoulderPush). The
-- file argues the whole arrangement.
--
-- Gen 2 keeps the native grid and rotates only the input intent through
-- World.pollInput; Gen 1 retains its existing continuous walk adapter.

--

-- in this mode, so while voxel mode is on the battle fades out, closes behind
-- the black, and the map fades up. The two seams it needs -- BattleState:finish
-- and Renderer:endFrame -- and the reasoning for each live in lib/BattleExit.lua.
--
-- Declared as a transitions record rather than a constant in that file, so the
-- fade is retunable in data exactly like the eight wipes it answers, and a total
-- conversion can make it as long or as short as its own pacing wants.
--
-- Gen 1 only, and only the RECORD is: `transitions` is one of the registries
-- with no Gen 2 home at all (src/mods/Schemas.lua:577, "Gold draws its own
-- battle intro"), so a write here on a Gen 2 boot is taken, dropped, and
-- reported on the mod manager's error feed. The fade itself is unaffected --
-- BattleExit.frames reads game.data.transitions for a tuned value and falls
-- back to BattleExit.FRAMES, so on Gold the shutter closes over the same 12
-- frames and only the retuning-in-data part is missing.

-- ------- and the hour on the flat world

-- that fell on the diorama left the flat world at permanent noon. One clock,
-- two worlds, one of them ignoring it. DayTint paints the same multiply over
-- the composited flat world, between the world blit and the UI blit; the
-- reasoning for that exact instant is in the file.

-- fallback, and also the DAYTIME row's own default.
