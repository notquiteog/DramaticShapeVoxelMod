-- Voxel world mode: the cooperative build budget.
--
-- Mesh building runs inside a plain coroutine that ChunkMesher pumps for
-- a few milliseconds a frame (there is no worker thread: LOVE's graphics
-- objects are main-thread only, and the build is pure Lua that slices
-- cleanly). The long loops in Structures and ChunkMesher call tick() as
-- they go; when the frame's slice is spent, tick() suspends the build
-- coroutine and the frame carries on rendering whatever is already
-- cached.
--
-- tick() is deliberately safe to call from ANY context: outside the pump
-- (headless tests, the pure geometry API, a driver poking a build
-- function directly) it recognises it is not inside the build coroutine
-- and does nothing, so synchronous callers keep their synchronous
-- behavior.

-- tick() can tell the build apart from any other coroutine the engine
-- happens to be running (drivers are coroutines too).
