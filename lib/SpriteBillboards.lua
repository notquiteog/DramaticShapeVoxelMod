-- Voxel world mode: characters as flat forward-facing sprite billboards.
--
-- Every character -- the player, NPCs, the ghosts standing on a neighbour
-- map -- is its CURRENT 2D sprite frame on a single flat quad. The sheets
-- carry real alpha and the shader discards it, so the quad cuts the
-- sprite's exact silhouette out of itself; no geometry is built from the
-- pixels and nothing about a sprite is voxelized.
--
-- That is deliberate. A sprite is a DRAWING, not an object seen from one
-- side: Gen 1's overworld figures are 16x16 icons with a fixed front-on
-- reading, and turning one into a solid -- whether a contoured slab or a
-- carved visual hull -- reconstructs a body the artist never drew and the
-- game never implied. It also had the mod ship a description of the ROM
-- art. One quad wearing the real frame is both more faithful and cheaper:
-- its baseline uses the visible pixels of the displayed frame.
--
-- Vanilla figures all read that dimension as a fixed 16, but a mod's
-- registered sprite (furniture, decor placed as an overworld entity) can
-- carry its own frameWidth/frameHeight the 2D path already honours -- see
-- buildCard below. The card stays a flat drawing either way; only its
-- size changes.
--
-- Cards remain upright. Free cameras turn their yaw only; shadows and visible
-- figures use the same grounded mesh. Mirrors and palette replacements retain
-- the original native sprite artwork.

-- One flat quad -- 16x16 for every vanilla figure, or the def's own

-- edge.
--
-- Mat4.billboard and Mat4.caster both place the finished card by the
-- closed form World = R * (Local - (8,0,0)) + (px+8, y, py+8): a fixed
-- local shift of 8 (half the vanilla 16px width) pulls the card's own
-- origin to its centre before the lean/yaw rotation R is applied, so it
-- pivots there instead of at its left edge, and only then is it placed at
-- the entity's tile centre. That local shift is fixed and shared by every
-- entity, so a wider card bakes its OWN half-width in here
-- (x0 = 8 - fw / 2) rather than asking the shared matrices to know each
-- sprite's size -- for fw == 16 that is x0 = 0, the original quad. Custom
-- anchors use the same convention as SpriteRenderer: anchorX measures from
-- the frame's left edge and anchorY measures down from its top edge.
