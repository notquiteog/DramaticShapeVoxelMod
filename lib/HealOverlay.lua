-- The Pokemon Center heal overlay, put where the machine actually is.
--
-- AnimateHealingMachine (engine/overworld/healing_machine.asm) is OAM: a
-- monitor tile over the console's screen and one ball per healed mon in two
-- mirrored columns, all blinking through the jingle.  The GB draws them at
-- FIXED screen coordinates with the player's cell BG-aligned at (64,64), and
-- the engine keeps that: fxHeal paints each tile at `ha.px - 64 + dx`,
-- `ha.py - 64 + dy`, and ctx.drawFx slides the whole block onto ONE projected
-- point -- the player's own feet.
--
-- That is exactly right for a flat renderer and wrong for this one.  The art
-- belongs about 60 world pixels north of the player, on a cabinet 17 voxels
-- tall; a perspective camera foreshortens that lever arm, so a rigid -60px
-- screen slide overshoots upward and the balls and the monitor hang in the
-- air over the machine.  Measured against the machine's own surfaces the
-- block rides ~9px high at the 35 degree rung and ~14px at 50 -- and the
-- monitor and the balls drift by DIFFERENT amounts, so no single corrected
-- anchor seats them both.  Only per-piece placement does.
--
-- So this hands back world points, not a screen offset.  The drawing that
-- voxel_heights.lua extrudes into the machine and the drawing the OAM lands
-- on are the same 32x32 grid, and Buildings extrudes its front elevation by
-- one rule -- drawn row r stands at height GROUND_ROW - r, from the base's
-- last row on the floor to the console's lid.  Reading the OAM offsets
-- through that rule is all it takes: the monitor comes out on the console's
-- face inside the inset the drawing cuts for it, and the balls come out on
-- the cabinet's front panel in the two columns the fascia notches.
--
-- Placing a piece is only half of it: it also has to be the right SIZE on
-- the machine, and the flat renderer's pixels-per-world-pixel is not that
-- number on every rung.  See `place` below, which measures it.
--
-- Kept OUT of the flat and tilt paths, which want the GB's own placement and
-- already get it.  See tests/heal_overlay_test.lua, which holds every number
-- below against the center_heal_machine template it was read off.

-- The plot, relative to the cell the player healed on.  Not a guess: the
-- engine paints the monitor tile at flat world (px - 20, py - 44), and that
-- tile's lit rectangle is the console inset at grid (13, 6) -- so the tile's
-- top-left is grid (12, 4) and the plot's north-west corner is 32 west and
-- 48 north of the heal cell.  Whichever machine of the pair the player is
-- standing at, they are standing at it the same way.
local PLOT_DX, PLOT_DY = -32, -48

local FRONT_Z, CONSOLE_Z = 26, 24

-- The whole front elevation extrudes upward off the floor line: drawn row 31
-- is the ground, the base band climbs to 14, the fascia's two rows are the

-- above it.  One rule the length of the machine.
local GROUND_ROW = 31

-- The OAM, engine-side (OverworldController's fxHeal and HEAL_BALL_XY): a
-- tile's top-left goes to flat world (ha.px - 64 + dx, ha.py - 64 + dy), so

-- Where the ink actually sits inside each 8x8 tile of the player's own

-- rectangle is x 1..6, y 2..4, and the ball is x 2..7, y 2..7.  The tile is
-- mostly margin, and it is the INK that has to land on the machine, so every

-- to height 3 and the cream lip at the machine's foot takes rows 29..30
-- below it, while the ball art's ink reaches down to height 2 -- a pixel
-- past the panel, hanging over the lip.
--
-- 1 to 3 is the whole usable range.  Below 1 the bottom row hangs over that
-- lip; above 3 the top row's ink reaches into the console's screen, the
-- inset drawn rows 6..8 whose bottom edge stands at height 22, covering the
-- very surface the monitor tile is drawn on.  Inside the range it is a
-- matter of looks, and 2 is the one that reads right on the machine.
--
