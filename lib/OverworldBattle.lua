-- Overworld battles: fights that happen on the map you were standing on.
--
-- The engine's battle is a screen: a white field with two pics on it, pushed
-- over a frozen overworld that stops drawing. This turns that white field
-- into the world -- the same terrain the free-roam mode extrudes, shot from
-- a placed over-the-shoulder camera at a clear patch of ground nearby --
-- while leaving the battle ITSELF alone. Every pic, HUD, HP bar, move
-- animation, faint slide and text box is the engine's own, drawn in the
-- engine's own order. What changes is what is behind them, and where the two
-- pics stand.
--
-- The sequence, from the moment something picks a fight:
--
--   1. the overworld cast is culled -- every NPC vanishes, so the wipe
--      plays over an empty map and no bystander is left standing in the
--      arena shot
--   2. the engine's own transition wipes the screen (untouched: it is the
--      right wipe, picked by the right three bits)
--   3. the battle draws over a live, window-resolution render of the arena,
--      with each mon PINNED to the cell it is standing on, the camera
--      drifting slowly enough to read as parallax, and a depth-of-field pass
--      holding the slab of world the two of them occupy sharp
--   4. the battle ends, the cast comes back, and the player is exactly
--      where they were standing
--
-- WHAT DOES NOT MOVE. The arena is where the CAMERA goes, not where the
-- player goes: nothing here writes a cell, a facing, a flag or a warp. A
-- real warp would have to survive trainer sight-lines, post-battle
-- dialogue, the blackout path and every script that assumes the player is
-- where it left them -- and it would have to put them back afterwards.
-- Moving the camera buys the whole shot and owes nothing back.
--
-- The feature declines cleanly rather than half-working: no depth support,
-- no open ground on the map, the row switched off, or a mesh still building
-- all end at the same place, which is the battle screen the engine has
-- always drawn.

-- `picScale` / `imageScale` / `panelScale`, and World:startBattle constructs
-- and pushes in one call so there is no unpushed battle to decorate.
-- Gen2Compat records all seven as ABSENT, with its reasons.
--
-- So this is not a gate over a working feature; it is the honest state of the
-- port. What DOES cross is the art itself: BATTLE ART's sprites reach Gold
-- through the engine's own `pokemon.sprite` hook (lib/InterfaceSprites.lua,
-- main.lua), which Gold raises with the same name and the same ctx keys -- so
-- a Gen 2 battle still fights with the selected generation's Pokemon, drawn on

-- is therefore native 1x: every source pixel stays a sharp screen pixel while
-- the block no longer reaches halfway across the arena and covers the foe.
-- The enemy block uses that same compact rung, so neither side dominates the
-- screen merely because its HUD was left at the letterbox scale.
--
-- They cannot simply be MOVED there: the engine draws them into the 160x144 UI

-- the world through. BATTLE LAYOUT's WIDE lays the same battle out on a
-- 304x144 surface (src/battle/WideBattle.lua), which moves every one of those
-- -- the mons would stand where no camera was solved for them, and the panels
-- would land beside the HUDs they are supposed to be under.

-- ------- the mons, as textures for the 3D pass
--
-- The two Pokemon are not composited over the world any more: they are quads

-- screen is a TEXTURE per side -- and the honest way to get one is to let the
-- engine draw its own pics layer, unchanged, into a canvas.
--
-- So the layer is rendered twice, once per side, with the other side
-- falsified out of existence by nulling exactly the fields its branches
-- test. Everything the engine does to a pic comes along for free that way:
-- the trainer pic before the send-out, the grow-out-of-the-ball scale, the
-- faint slide, the damage blink, the squish, every SE displacement. None of
-- it is reimplemented and none of it can drift.
--
-- Two things are forced during that render. The scale, to 1, so the texture
-- carries the artwork's own pixels and the BILLBOARD does the sizing; and the
-- placement, so the pic lands centred on a known column with its feet on a
