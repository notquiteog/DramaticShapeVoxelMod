--
-- What is up there differs by rung, and the sky follows it rather than being
-- retuned for each. At 75 degrees the camera is pitched far enough over that
-- the horizon is genuinely in frame, and the bands run down to meet it. At the
-- steeper rungs the horizon is above the top edge and the void that shows is
-- where the ground runs OUT -- past the map edge, past the curve -- so the
-- bands take a fixed slice of the frame instead (lib/Sky.lua, Sky.SPAN) and the
-- haze below them fills the rest.
--
-- INDOORS THERE IS NO SKY. A house, a cave or a gym is a room with a
-- ceiling, and the void past its walls is the outside of a box, not open
-- air. Map.isOutdoor is the same test the engine uses for door SFX and the
-- town map, and the same one Structures already asks to decide whether a
-- map rings with trees.
--

-- turns a face into a mesh. (The battle pass makes the opposite call for its

-- ------- the water pass
--
-- Between the terrain and everything that stands on it, because water is a
-- MIRROR and a mirror can only reflect what is already down: the ground, the
-- shoreline, the trees and buildings behind it, and the sky the frame opened
-- with.
--
-- THE CAST IS THE AWKWARD ONE, and it is settled by drawing it twice. Gen 1
-- draws people over the world and water is world, so a surfing player has to
-- composite OVER the water they are sitting on -- which puts them after it,
-- and a reflection can only hold what came before it. So `cast` is painted
-- into the reflection copy alone (Voxel3D.beginWater), where it is in the
-- picture the water reflects and not yet in the picture the water is drawn
-- into. Both draws go through drawCast, so they cannot come out different.
--
-- The ray march finds them the honest way round: a sprite is not in the
-- DEPTH buffer at that point, so a ray aimed at one passes through to the
-- terrain standing behind it and reads the copy there -- where the sprite is
-- already painted. The reflection lands a hair off the sprite's own depth
-- and exactly on its colour, which at a lake's worth of ripple is the same
-- picture.
--
-- `draws` is a list of { mesh, texture, model }. Nothing is a special case:
-- with the row OFF, no depth texture to read, or a shader that would not
-- build, the same meshes go through the ordinary scene shader and come out
-- as the flat animated water this mode always drew.
-- The overworld's alone: the staged battle draws its water plain, always --
-- its placed camera reads this pass wrong, and a stage set wants painted
-- water anyway (see BattleScene, where the choice is argued).
-- ------- and why the flat draw happens FIRST while the world is curved
--
-- The reflective pass writes no depth -- it cannot, the depth canvas is
-- detached for the length of it so the shader can READ it -- and it does its
-- own depth test against that texture instead. That test asks whether
-- something opaque is in front, and it answers correctly for every case but
-- one: WATER IN FRONT OF WATER. Nothing puts water in the depth buffer, so
-- no lake can hide another, and the pass simply paints them in mesh order.
--
-- On a flat world that never matters: every surface lies in the one plane
-- at its own recessed height, and a farther sheet always lands farther down
-- the screen. THE WORLD CURVE ENDS THAT. The bend drops the world by the
-- square of its distance, so the far side of the map swings down and back
-- up into the near field of view -- and a sheet of sea a hundred and fifty
-- tiles away, drawn later in the same mesh, paints straight over the pond
-- at the player's feet. Not a reflection of the far shore: the far shore
-- itself, rasterised on top of the water in front of you.
--
-- So WHILE THE CURVE IS ON, the meshes go down flat first, through the
-- ordinary scene shader with depth writes on, and the reflective pass draws
-- over the top of what survived: the depth buffer now holds the water
-- surface, so the pass's own test throws the far sheet away, and the
-- reflection COPY holds it too, so a ray grazing another part of the lake
-- reads water rather than the void behind it.
--
-- With the curve OFF the prepass is not just unnecessary, it is a LIABILITY,
-- and it stays off -- the reflective pass tests only against terrain, as it
-- always did. Painting the surface into the depth texture turns the pass's
-- test into a comparison of the surface against ITSELF, which asks the two
-- rasterisations to agree to within interpolation error -- and on mobile
-- GPUs they don't reliably (that fight is what put the Android port back on
-- flat water). Confined to the curve there is no regression to reach: the
-- flat world never had the far-shore bug in the first place.
