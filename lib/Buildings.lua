-- Voxel world mode: a building voxelized from its own sprite.
--
-- A Game Boy overworld building is a fake-3D projection that packs several
-- different 3D facings into one flat drawing: the roof is drawn as if seen
-- from above, the facade as if seen face-on, and the sloped ends as
-- diagonal silhouettes. Raising the whole footprint as one box (what the
-- generic volume path does) folds all three into a wall, so a house comes
-- out as a cube wearing its own elevation.
--
-- This module does the other thing: it classifies each BAND of the drawing
-- by the surface it depicts and applies the matching operation per band --
-- the pipeline written up in assets/docs/buidling_to_voxel/. Two rules govern it:
--
--   1. Every visible voxel colour is a real texel of the drawing. Nothing
--      is invented but the geometry the sprite implies and never paints
--      (undersides, the depth behind the facade), and those wear the
--      drawing's own four shades.
--   2. The sprite is ground truth, not the tile grid. The silhouette, the
--      taper rate, the eave height and every window are MEASURED off the
--      pixels; the profile only says which rows are roof and which are
--      facade.
--
-- The pipeline, per template (see data/voxel_heights.lua `buildings`):
--
--   read     composite the building out of the atlas and flood its
--            silhouette in from the border through light pixels only --
--            the black outline and the #555 shading together are the
--            boundary, and a "not black" test eats the shaded flanks.
--   measure  the topmost drawn row of each column IS the roof's elevation
--            profile (the drawn taper is the slope); the facade's panes
--            are the non-black regions its black frames seal off.
--   build    facade rows extrude straight back over the footprint, the
--            awning band juts past them, panes sink one voxel, and the
--            roof lays the top-facing rows flat -- level over the
--            plateau, stepping down the drawn taper at the ends -- then
--            overwrites the walls it intersects.
--   emit     cull to the shell and merge runs of texel-adjacent faces into
--            single quads, so a 90k-voxel house ships as ~2k quads.
--
-- One model is built per template and stamped at every placement: Red's
-- and Blue's houses are the same seven-placement drawing, so they cost one
-- build between them. mods/BATTLE_ART_VOXEL_FORK/tools/building_voxels.py is the
-- reference implementation of the same algorithm and prints the voxel and
-- shell counts this one must agree with.
--
-- Purely presentational, like everything else in the mod: the tiles a
-- building claims keep the collision, warps and triggers they always had.

-- ------- how far a merged run may reach: the tile lattice
--
-- Merging is what keeps a 90k-voxel house down to ~2k quads, and under a
-- straight projection a run may be as long as it likes -- a straight line
-- is a straight line however finely it is cut. THE WORLD CURVE IS NOT
-- STRAIGHT. It drops every vertex by the square of its distance from the
-- focus (see WorldCurve), so a quad's interior is the CHORD of a parabola
-- its neighbours draw the arc of: a run of length L hangs k*L^2/4 below
-- the short quads butted against it, and the join tears open.
--
-- Nothing bounded a run's length before, and the runs that ran away were
-- the ones wearing a CONSTANT texel -- the roof's black eave outline, its
-- fascia, the shaded underside -- because a flat run has no art to break
-- it. Those reached 102px across a gym, which at V-CURVE 3 hangs some
-- three world pixels under the roof surface beside it: the eave tore off
-- the roof and the drop showed the building's dark interior through the
-- slot. (Strip runs, the drawing marching along the atlas, break at the
-- tileset's own boundaries and were never the problem.)
--
-- So a run stops at the next 8px lattice line. Buildings are stamped at
-- tx*8 (see stamp), so the model's lattice IS the map's: every quad in the
-- scene -- terrain, props, this -- now ends on the same lines, every join
-- is vertex-for-vertex, and the bend carries them together. What is left
-- is the sag WITHIN one cell, k*64/4, which is under a twentieth of a
-- world pixel at any rung.
--
-- It costs quads on a dense city map (Cerulean's object stream goes from
-- 35.7k to 41.6k, and its longest edge from 102px to 8px) and it costs them
-- whether the curve is on or not, which is the deliberate trade: the mesh
-- is cached per map and built asynchronously over seconds, so meshing for
-- the curve's sake only when the curve is on would mean rebuilding every
-- live map on a keypress.
