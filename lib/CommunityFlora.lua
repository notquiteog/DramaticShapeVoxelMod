-- FLORA: grass with height to it, and the small moving things.
-- payload-version: 67
--
-- TUFTS.  Dramatic Shape stands two thin rows of grass per tile, evenly,
-- which is honest to the art and reads as a lawn.  Tall grass in this
-- game is supposed to be where things live.  This adds extra blades at
-- hashed positions and varied heights across every encounter cell -- the
-- engine's own Map:isGrassCell decides which those are -- built as
-- crossed pairs so a blade reads from any angle, and textured from the
-- tileset's own grass art.  Deterministic by position: the same meadow
-- grows the same way every time you walk into it, which is what stops it
-- shimmering.
--
-- PARTICLES.  Three kinds, all short-lived camera-facing motes drawn
-- from textures generated here at load (no asset ships, and none is
-- derived from anything):
--
--   SEEDS    kicked up behind you while you move through tall grass --
--            the visible reason to be wary of it
--   DRIPS    falling in caves, with a splash at the bottom, seeded on
--            the ceiling above wherever you are
--   FIREFLIES  outdoors after dark, bobbing low over grass, slow and few
--   LEAVES   drifting down under the forest canopy, tumbling as they fall
--   DUST     motes turning slowly in the air of an interior
--   FOAM     spray lifting off the water's edge
--   SMOKE    rising from a building's chimney, thinning as it climbs
--   RUSTLE   very occasionally, a shudder in a distant grass cell with
--            nothing attached to it -- purely to make you look
--
-- DARKNESS.  Gen 1's unlit floors exist so that Flash has a point, but a
-- top-down view can only express that as a smaller window.  Standing in
-- one, it should be dark.  This nests translucent shells around the eye:
-- anything a long way off sits behind several of them and fades toward
-- black, anything close sits in front of them all and is clear.  The
-- engine's own answer decides when -- field.darkMaps for the floor,
-- save.flashLit for whether Flash is up -- so using Flash genuinely
-- pushes the walls back, which in 2D it never quite did.
--
-- RAIN.  Gen 1 has no weather, so this mod keeps its own: long dry
-- spells broken by showers, on a clock seeded per session, outdoors only.
-- Drops fall around the eye and burst on landing; the world does not get
-- wet, because nothing here may touch the game.  While it rains every
-- NPC puts up an UMBRELLA -- a small pixel canopy generated in code,
-- bobbing with their walk -- which is the single cheapest way to make a
-- town feel like it noticed the weather.
--
-- SHAFTS.  Under the forest canopy, angled slabs of pale light lean down
-- through the leaves, drifting slowly so the wood never looks still.
--
-- FOG.  Lavender Town and its tower wear pale shells, the same trick the
-- cave dark uses but reversed: distance whitens instead of blackening.
--
-- Everything here is presentational: no collision, no encounter rates, no
-- movement.  Particles live in a fixed pool and are recycled, so a long
-- walk costs no more than a short one.

-- this stacks further courses of the same rock on top, rising toward
-- the cluster's interior like a massif: each cell's height grows with
-- its distance from the cluster's edge, so rims stay low and hearts
-- peak. Every face is textured with the cell's OWN subtiles, band by
-- band, so the drawn rock simply continues upward.
--
-- The gate stack, in the order the ghosts taught: authored tile id AND
-- authored upright class AND not walkable AND outdoors AND not in a
-- connection band. No stamps, no registry -- this derives from stable
-- map data alone.
-- Retuned after the community review (issue thread): the massif now
-- BLANKETS its cluster -- every rock cell carries at least two courses
-- so the yellow-hued ranges read as solid mountains rather than
-- scattered spires, at the cost of some horizon (their words: worth
-- it). MIN drops so small outcrops join in; REACH drops and the
-- building veto widens so no structure ever inherits rock again.

-- tile outward, ring by ring, stepping gently down and fading with the
-- same haze the neighbour maps use -- grass runs on as grass, water as
-- water, because the tile IS the edge it extends. Built once per map as
-- a single mesh from the atlas already bound: no new textures, a few
-- hundred quads, memory cost as near nothing as makes no difference.
--
-- It sits a shade BELOW true ground, so real terrain -- and Dramatic
-- Shape's own neighbour-map meshes on the connected sides -- always draw

-- ------- THE CANOPY.
-- Under the trees the mod's own particles were falling through open
-- black: Viridian Forest has walls of trees but no roof, because the 2D
-- game never needed one.  This grows one.  Every cell gets a leaf panel
-- at a hashed height between two limits, so the underside is stepped and
-- uneven rather than a flat lid, and the panels wear the wood's own
-- foliage art.  Roughly one cell in nine is left OPEN -- a gap in the
-- leaves -- which is where the daylight and the sun shafts come through,
-- and what stops it reading as a ceiling with a texture on it.

-- THE EDGE OF THE WOOD.  A curtain hung on the map's rim reads as a wall
-- with leaves on it, because that is what it is.  Beyond the rim there
-- is now a RING of further trees -- trunks at varied heights under the
-- same canopy -- and the curtain moves out behind them.  You see wood
-- receding into wood, and the wall that stops you seeing further is
-- three trees away rather than one.
-- ------- VINES.
-- Strands hanging from the underside of the canopy: a couple of pixels
-- of stem with stubs off it, swaying on the same slow clock the grass
-- uses -- and swinging when you walk through them.
--
-- The swing is the interesting part.  A mesh is drawn with ONE matrix,
-- so a single vine cannot be moved without moving every vine with it.
-- The strands are therefore built into BLOCKS of eight cells square,
-- each its own mesh: walking through a block disturbs that block and
-- nothing else, which at this scale reads as "the vines you just pushed
-- through".  Distant wood keeps swaying gently.
--

-- AMBIENCE.  One looping bed per kind of place -- cave, forest, town,
-- route -- crossfaded as you move between them, silent indoors.  The
-- files ride the same pipeline as the poster sheets: installed into
-- Dramatic Shape's assets/legendary folder and streamed from there, so a missing
-- file costs its bed and nothing else.
--
-- WHICH BED a map wants is decided the way the rest of this module
-- decides everything: tileset first (CAVERN and FOREST are authored),
-- then the map's own id for the outdoor split -- TOWN/CITY ids get the
-- town bed, everything else outdoors is a route.  Interiors fade all
-- four out rather than stopping dead, so walking into a Mart sounds
-- like a door closing behind you.
--
-- THE WATCHDOG.  Flora.draw only runs while a voxel rung is live, so
-- dropping to 2D (or the mode failing) would strand the beds playing
-- forever.  A once-only wrap of love.update watches for the heartbeat
-- Flora.draw leaves each frame and fades everything out when it stops.
-- zero new top-level locals: this main chunk sits exactly at Lua's
-- 200-local cap, so the whole feature hangs off MOUND, which exists
