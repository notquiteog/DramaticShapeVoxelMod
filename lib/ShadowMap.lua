-- Voxel world mode: the sun's own pass -- a real shadow map.
--
-- The old drop shadows were decals: each character's sprite frame squashed
-- flat onto the ground plane it stood on. That can only ever paint the
-- FLOOR, so a shadow stopped dead at the foot of a wall, and nothing but a
-- character cast one at all -- buildings, trees, signs and ledges threw
-- nothing.
--
-- So render the scene once from the sun instead. An orthographic camera
-- pointed down the sun line stores, per texel, how far the light travelled
-- before it hit something; the main pass transforms each fragment into that
-- same space and asks whether anything got there first. What the sun cannot
-- see is in shadow, whatever surface it happens to be -- so a shadow climbs
-- a wall, drapes over a roof and slides across a passing NPC without a
-- single case in the code, and every caster is simply whatever the pass
-- draws: the terrain mesh (buildings, trees, ledges, props -- all of it)
-- plus one upright card per character.
--
-- Depth is stored in an ORDINARY color canvas, packed into two 8-bit
-- channels (~16 bits over the frustum, well under a tenth of a world
-- pixel). A readable depth texture would be tidier, but depth sampling is
-- the least portable corner of the graphics API and this mod's whole
-- contract is that an unsupported driver falls back rather than errors --
-- everything here is pcall-guarded and `available()` reports the result,
-- with VoxelScene dropping back to the flat decal shadows when it says no.

-- The sun, as the shear a shadow takes: a point `y` world-pixels above the
-- ground drops its shadow (KX*y, KZ*y) away from the point under it. Both
-- negative hangs the sun in the SOUTHEAST, so every shadow falls northwest
-- -- up and to the left on screen, since the camera puts north at the top
-- and east to the right at every tilt.
--
-- Their MAGNITUDE is how low the sun sits: hypot(KX, KZ) = 1.01 puts it
-- about 45 degrees up, so a 16px character throws a shadow about as long
-- as it is tall -- against the 62-degree noon these started at, which read
-- as a smudge under everybody's feet.
--
-- Their RATIO is the compass bearing, and it leans WEST of northwest on
-- purpose. A character is drawn as a slab leaning back away from the
-- camera, which covers the ground directly north of its feet -- so a
-- shadow thrown due north lands entirely underneath the figure casting it
-- and is never seen. At 0.85 west the shadow reaches 13px out against the
-- sprite's own 8px half-width, so it clears the slab and reads, while 0.55
-- north still puts it a clear 23 degrees up from horizontal on screen.

-- Shadow map edge, in texels -- chosen per frame from this ladder, because
-- the light frustum is sized to the WORLD VIEW and that swings by 3x
-- between the closest zoom and a maximised window at the widest. A fixed
-- edge is either wasteful at one end or a blur at the other.
--
-- TARGET is the world pixels per texel worth paying for: at a third of a
-- pixel a shadow edge lands inside the pixel grid this whole mode exists
-- to keep crisp, and finer buys nothing the grid can show. The smallest
-- size that meets it wins, and the ladder tops out at 2048 (16 MB, and the
-- depth buffer behind it matches) rather than chasing the target forever.

-- The tallest geometry the pass covers: gabled buildings and border forest
-- run well under this, and the margin it buys costs only resolution --
-- with the sun this low the frustum has to widen by most of HEIGHT again
-- on every side to catch what casts in from off-screen.
ShadowMap.HEIGHT = 160

-- Depth slack at the comparison, in world pixels. Too little and a lit
-- surface shadows itself in a moire of acne; too much and a shadow detaches
-- from the foot of what casts it. The frustum is ~400 world pixels deep and
-- the packed depth resolves under 0.01 of one, so there is room.
--
-- It cannot be ONE number, because what the comparison has to forgive is
-- not fixed: the map stores one depth for a whole texel, so a lit surface
-- reads its own depth wrong by however far it RAMPS across that texel --
-- the texel's world size times the surface's slope in the light's frame.
-- The texel swings from a third of a world pixel at the closest zoom to
-- well over one at a maximised window on the widest, so a constant bias is
-- generous at one end of the ladder and short at the other. Short shows up
-- as diagonal bands of acne across big lit surfaces -- diagonal because
-- the moire runs along neither the world grid nor the screen's, but along
-- the depth ramp in the sun's own frame, and the sun sits southeast.
--
-- So: a floor for what does not scale (the packed depth's quantisation,
-- and the two passes reaching the same world point by different matrices),
-- plus a term in texels for what does.
ShadowMap.BIAS = 0.5

-- World pixels of slack per world pixel of texel, for the steepest LIT
-- surface here: a roof pitched 45 degrees and turned away from the sun,
-- whose depth ramps about 3.1 world pixels per texel crossed on EITHER of
-- the light frame's two axes (a vertical wall, by comparison, manages 1.7,
-- flat ground 0.7, and anything steeper than that roof has its back to the
-- sun and never reads the map at all). The 2x2 filter's taps sit half a
-- texel out on both axes at once, so the worst a tap can disagree by is
-- half the ramp along each -- which is where the halving that turns 6.2
-- into 3.1 comes from, and why it is the SUM of the two components rather
-- than their magnitude.
--
-- Measured against the artefact rather than trusted: the probe
-- (tests/voxel_acne_probe.lua) counts isolated shadowed pixels on lit
-- surfaces, and the banding stops at slack ~2.4 world px on the widest
-- rung -- where this lands 3.1 * 0.83 + 0.5.
ShadowMap.SLOPE = 3.1
