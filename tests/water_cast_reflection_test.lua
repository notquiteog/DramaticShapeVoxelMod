-- The cast's PLANAR reflection: each card reflected in the water plane and
-- flipped, drawn into a canvas of its own, composited by the water shader at
-- each fragment's own screen position.
--
-- Why not a mirrored CAMERA, which is the obvious way: a character is a
-- billboard that leans back to face the camera, so a mirrored camera catches
-- it leaning away and lands a foreshortened sliver in the water. Correct for
-- the flat quad it really is, useless as a reflection of the person it is
-- pretending to be. A billboard is a fake that works from one side only, so
-- reflecting it has to be faked too: reflect the POSITION, keep the card
-- facing the camera, flip it about its own feet.
--
-- What is pinned here is the arithmetic and the wiring, which are the parts
-- a screenshot cannot check. The LOOK is not testable in this harness.
